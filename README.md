A site to capture recruit readiness based on a true/false checklist. Unweighted percentage score is calculated.

It can be hard to normalize interview feedback scores across different teams. A significant source of the inconsistency happens with numeric scoring. Interviewers will have different perceptions about the meaning of a 10, for instance. Usually folks recommend a Qualitative Description (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale#Qualitative_description). But even then some responders will be varyingly reluctant to give the top score. And it's not recommended to average this type of data, but of course it's almost always done, in order to aggregate the data.

The solution I like most for this is based on the Checklist Manifesto (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto). You can actually differentiate candidates well by using only yes/no answers, which will be more consistent across respondents than 1 to 10 type numeric scales.
 
Apple of Knowledge is a proof-of-concept that calculates a Total Score as you fill in the form.

I've given a lot of thought to these yes/no questions. But you can imagine adding others. Or even providing weights for the questions, possibly based on role.
